# mafiaLite

Want to play mafia with your friends, but only have a small group and don't want to bother keeping track of everything? In that case, mafiaLite is for you! As a terminal based pass and play mafia style game, it is much quicker and simpler than normal mafia, while retaining all the mind games and trickery. Here are the rules, from the game text: 
###
```
Each player is randomly chosen to be a member of one of two factions, town and mafia.
The village is secured when there are no killings in a round. Keep suspected mafia off the patrol!
Town members are unaware of anyone else's role, but the mafia know everything.
There are 2 mafiosos in 5-6 player matches, and 3 in 7-8 player ones.

5 rounds are played, or until a faction achieves their goal in 3 rounds (3 murders or 3 secures).
Each round has two phases: the talking phase, and the mission phase.
Talking phase:
Players discuss who will be chosen secure the town that round.
The town wants to keep suspected mafia off the patrol each round to avoid killings.
Discussion occurs until a majority is reached and a decision is made.
Mission phase:
Each player takes their turn. Town cannot do anything except continue and appear inconspicious!
When chosen to secure the town, the mafia can either kill, or decline to do so, going under the radar.
Otherwise, the mafia cannot take an action either.

It is extremely important for the town to figure out the truth.
If public discourse is infiltrated, the interloper will wreak havoc without fail.
Good luck....
